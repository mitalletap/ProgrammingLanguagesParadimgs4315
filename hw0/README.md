How to run the code:



python3 infint.py <input_file>.txt >> <inputfile>.out
bash compareRes.sh
cat grade

IF YOU RUN THE BASH FILE AND GET THIS ERROR: 
"compareRes.sh: line 46: 10*(1 - 1)/0: division by 0 (error token is "0")"
FROM THE SERVER, YOU MUST MANUALLY GO IN AND EDIT THE ANS.OUT FILES WITH THE CORRECT OUTPUT. There is an issue where if you edit the ans.out file from an OS other than linux, it will not process correctly. 

(EXAMPLE):
nano ans1.out
[change the file contents and save] (remove any additional spaces)
bash compareRes.sh


THIS WAS THE ERROR I WAS GETTING AND THIS WAS THE SOLUTION TO FIX IT. I SPOKE TO THE PROFESSOR AND INFORMATED HIM AS WELL.
